Methods to characterize X-ray dips in X-ray binary lightcurves. Supports undergraduate research project

This will house notebooks and methods written by students working to characterize X-ray binary lightcurves. Initially at least, this will likely focus on issues like phase calculation, isolating dips and characterizing their properties and occurence.
