# um-d-xraydips
Methods to characterize X-ray dips in X-ray binary lightcurves. Supports undergraduate research project

This will house notebooks and methods written by students working to characterize X-ray binary lightcurves. Initially at least, this will likely focus on issues like phase calculation, isolating dips and characterizing their properties and occurence. (Secondary, perhaps more important motive: help students gain experience working on collaborative projects via github.)
